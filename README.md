# Oscillations_toroidal_topology
Code for the paper 'The role of oscillations in grid cells' toroidal topology'.
Data from Gardner et al. should be stored in the folder Toroidal_topology_grid_cell_data after download from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Toroidal_topology_of_population_activity_in_grid_cells/16764508

## Gamma_computation
Provides the code to compute the degree of toroidal topology ${\bf \Gamma}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}_{self}$ given a set of barcodes from persistent cohomology.

## synthetic_dataset
Code for the simulation of poisson grid cell modules (uses functions stored in multi_sample_funcs.py)

## utils
Modified version of utility functions file from https://github.com/erikher/GridCellTorus.
